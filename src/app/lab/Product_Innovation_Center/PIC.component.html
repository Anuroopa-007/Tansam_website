      <h2>Case Study</h2>
      <p>
        A startup in the consumer electronics domain collaborated with the Product Innovation Centre at TANSAM to develop a compact, multifunctional IoT device for smart home automation. The team used Siemens NX to model the enclosure and internal layout, ensuring both aesthetics and manufacturability. FEA simulations helped validate mechanical durability under drop and thermal stress. Parallelly, the PCB layout and circuit design were completed and tested for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Iterative virtual prototyping enabled rapid refinements and a functional prototype was delivered in under 6 weeks. This streamlined workflow reduced product development time by 50% and ensured the design met both performance and cost objectives—demonstrating TANSAM’s capability in accelerating product innovation.
