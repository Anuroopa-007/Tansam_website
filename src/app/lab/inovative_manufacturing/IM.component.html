        <b>Reverse Engineering:</b> 	Any Complex Components can be converted in digital model by using 3d Scanner (Calibry mini–Hand held 3d Scanner) in which it captures the primitive of the component and the gives output as exact Replication of the product. Further Digital reconstruction of the parts, Parametric modeling using Seimens NX and Solid Edge

        <h2>Case Study</h2>
        <p>
          A leading MSME in the automotive sector approached the Tamil Nadu Smart Manufacturing Centre for rapid prototyping of a discontinued yet critical engine component. Using a handheld 3D scanner (Calibry Mini), the original worn-out part was digitally captured and reverse-engineered using Siemens NX. The digital model was then optimized and 3D printed using Markforged’s metal printer, producing a high-strength, functional prototype in under 72 hours. This reduced production downtime, eliminated the need for expensive tooling, and highlighted the center’s ability to deliver end-to-end smart manufacturing solutions.
