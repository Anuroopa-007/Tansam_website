      <h2>Case Study</h2>
      <p>
        An electric vehicle (EV) startup was facing challenges in optimizing the thermal performance and structural integrity of a battery enclosure unit. The Predictive Engineering Lab collaborated with the startup to develop a digital twin of the battery system using Simcenter 3D and Star CCM+. CFD simulations were conducted to evaluate airflow and heat dissipation, while FEA was applied to assess the structural behavior under vibration and impact loads. Design modifications based on simulation results improved thermal efficiency by 22% and reduced material usage by 15%. This virtual validation approach eliminated the need for multiple physical prototypes and accelerated the product’s market readiness by over 30%, demonstrating the lab’s expertise in simulation-driven product development.
