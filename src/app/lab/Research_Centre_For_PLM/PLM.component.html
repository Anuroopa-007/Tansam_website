        <h2>Case Study</h2>
        <p>
          A leading MSME in the automotive sector approached the Tamil Nadu Smart Manufacturing Centre for rapid prototyping of a discontinued yet critical engine component. Using a handheld 3D scanner (Calibry Mini), the original worn-out part was digitally captured and reverse-engineered using Siemens NX. The digital model was then optimized and 3D printed using Markforged’s metal printer, producing a high-strength, functional prototype in under 72 hours. This reduced production downtime, eliminated the need for expensive tooling, and highlighted the center’s ability to deliver end-to-end smart manufacturing solutions.
